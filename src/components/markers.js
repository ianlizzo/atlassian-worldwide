      "Picture yourself in the city by the bay. Full of neighborhoods as unique as its people. Head over to the Mission, home of some of the best burritos on the planet, or to SoMa where you’ll find AT&T Park and Atlassian’s SF office. That's San Francisco: up a hill to a new vista, down another to a different park, cafe, or cool bar. Now add to that a job in the playground of global technology, and the home of Atlassian's global marketing and business teams (think Finance, Legal, HR). And, San Francisco is just the beginning. As we grow, so will our SF Bay Area team.",

      "Only 40 miles from San Francisco, our Mountain View office has a character all its own. Our newest hub for mobile and cloud development, this space has all of the dev-friendly things you’d expect to find in the offices of a fast-growing startup—fresh whiteboards, big ideas, and heaps of gluten free snacks. But, there’s also something more established here. The Atlassian values painted largely across the second floor walls remind this small, but mighty crew of the resources, expertise, and spirit that surrounds them.",

Our fourth US location and first on the east coast, we knew that NYC was home to a lively group of Atlassian customers given the success of our local User Group. As we welcome even more Atlassians to the team, we're poised for big things in the Big Apple. Today, we're in the process of growing all of our teams based here. With opportunities to build and design for Trello or support the growing community of Atlassian customers, we have a ton of interesting roles to explore. Like all of our offices, there's a unique flavor to the local culture, but you'll also find a connectedness to the broader Atlassian universe created through our shared values.",

Atlassian Manila serves as our global shared services hub. The team provides mission-critical support in the areas of finance, recruiting, HR, and... nerf guns? Yep, we often break up the day with fierce nerf gun battles and PS4 powered dance-offs.",

Our plan is to build a fully-staffed R&D center that mirrors the structure (and character) of Atlassian offices around the globe. The code shipped from Bengaluru will impact our global customer base. And, the culture built here will be an extension of our company's shared values. Beyond product development positions available in engineering, product management, and design, we'll also build an on-site Atlassian team to provide customer support across our products, platforms, and other paid offerings. Our customer support team in Bengaluru will be integrated as the newest member of our existing global support teams. ",

Our area also contains a large Chinatown with hundreds of Chinese restaurants and shops. And of course, we can't forget about the Sankei-en Garden, a botanical park containing preserved Japanese residences from different eras. We work to support all the lovely folks here in Japan at Atlassian K.K. — K.K. is short for “Kabushiki Kaisha,” which is equivalent of Inc. or Pty Ltd in Japanese.",
